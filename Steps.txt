Steps To Make MultiDB When Adding a Domian:
	- for each db make dbcontext
		==> mainContext --> will have the domian table to save the connection strings on it
			This Will have a migration and update DB
			(Add-Migration InitialMainMigration -Context MainDbContext -OutputDir Migrations/MainDb)
			(Update-Database -Context DbContext_Multi)
		==> otherContext --> will have other models (tables)
			This Will only have a migration
			(Add-Migration InitialMainMigration -Context OtherDbContext -OutputDir Migrations/MainDb)
	- in appsettings ==> default connectionString (mainContext DB)
	- Also in the program.cs
	- Make the endpoint that calles the services to make the row in domain table and also create the Db and migrate it
	- This service will be injected in the program.cs

Steps To Call Data From a Specific DB According To Domain:
	- Middleware to get the domian name from header and get the connection string from the DB
	- service to get optionsBuilder (Connection)
	- Controller
